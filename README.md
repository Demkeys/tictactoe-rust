# tictactoe-rust
A Tic Tac Toe console game I made for practice, as a beginner in Rust.

---
To use:
- Drag [tictactoe_game.rs](https://github.com/Demkeys/tictactoe-rust/blob/main/tictactoe_game.rs) into your project.
- Add the following code to your ```main.rs ``` file
```
mod tictactoe_game;
use tictactoe_game::game_loop;
```
- Then you can call ```game_loop()``` in your ```main()``` function.
